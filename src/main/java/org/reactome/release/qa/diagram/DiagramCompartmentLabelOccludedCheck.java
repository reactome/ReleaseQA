/**
 * Check for diagram Compartment nodes whose label is significantly
 * occluded by another node. Only non-reaction database entity nodes
 * are checked. A compartment node A is checked for overlapping the
 * label of another compartment node B if and only if A is contained
 * in B or if A and B are different nodes for the same database
 * compartment object.
 * 
 * <em>Note</em>: as of 07/2019, this QA check is disabled in the
 * ExcludedChecks list, since it reports labels that overlap but
 * are sufficiently readable or are too difficult for crators to
 * identify or correct, e.g. the
 * <code>Other responses of Mtb to phagocytosis</code> diagram:
 * <p>
 * If you look at the full diagram, you will notice that Host cell
 * cytosol is distinguished from Bacteria cell cytosol by changing
 * the label. In the case of Bacteria cell cytosol, the text Bacteria
 * cell is prepended to the standard label cytosol. That is not a
 * problem with the QA check. However, in the case of the host cell,
 * the standard label cytosol is placed in the middle of the compartment
 * but buried beneath other entities to obscure it. Then the free-form
 * text Bacteria cell cytosol is added in a visible location completely
 * separate from the standard label.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The remedy for this case is to qualify the cytosol compartment in the
 * same way that it is done for bacteria: remove cytosol from the text
 * and move the standard label to the visible location in its place. If
 * that is done, then the issue will not be reported. It is arguably a
 * cleaner approach to qualify the compartment label in this way with a
 * prefix rather than hide and replace the standard label.
 * </p>
